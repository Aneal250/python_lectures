# QUESTION 5
# Write a program that calculates and displays a person's body mass index (BMI). The BMl is often
# used to determine whether a person is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A person's
# BMI is calculated with the following formula:
# BMI = weight x 703/height?
# where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. The program should ask
# the user to enter his or her weight and height and then display the user's BMI.
# The program should also display a message indicating whether the person has optimal weight, is
# underweight, or is overweight. A person's weight is considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is
# between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight. If
# the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.


# write function problem
# BMI = weight x 703/height 
#  weight and height

# cal bmi
# def calculateBMI(weight, height):
#     bmi = (weight * 703) / (height ** 2)
#     return bmi

# def output 
#   # accept input weight and height
#   calculate_bmi = calculateBMI(weight, height)
#   if calculate_bmi < 18.5:
#         return "Underweight"
#     elif calculate_bmi > 25:
#         return "Overweight"
#     else:
#         return "Optimal weight"
